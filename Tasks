If you publish to npm, ensure your package.json includes:
main and exports fields for entry points.
types field if you provide TypeScript types (recommended for wider adoption).
repository, bugs, and homepage fields.
Consider adding TypeScript type definitions (either inline or via DefinitelyTyped) for better editor support.
If you use GitHub, add an issue template and pull request template.

Consider moving all core logic to src/ (with subfolders for consent, dsar, etc.) and using lib/ for build outputs or compatibility shims, as is common in some Node.js projects. However, your current structure is also acceptable.
